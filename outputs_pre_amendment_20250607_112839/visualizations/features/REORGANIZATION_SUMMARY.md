# Feature Plots Reorganization Summary

## Date: 2025-05-31

### What Was Done

1. **Reorganized Feature Plots Structure**:
   - Moved all individual model plots from root directory to appropriate subdirectories
   - Moved comparison/aggregate plots to a dedicated `comparisons/` directory
   - Removed duplicate plots that existed in both root and subdirectories

2. **Updated Directory Structure**:
   ```
   features/
   ├── catboost/      (8 plots) - CatBoost model feature importance
   ├── lightgbm/      (8 plots) - LightGBM model feature importance
   ├── xgboost/       (8 plots) - XGBoost model feature importance
   ├── elasticnet/    (4 plots) - ElasticNet model feature importance
   ├── linear/        (4 plots) - Linear Regression feature importance
   ├── comparisons/   (9 plots) - Cross-model comparisons and aggregates
   └── README.md
   ```

3. **Updated Code for Future Consistency**:
   - Modified `src/visualization/plots/features.py`:
     - Individual plots now automatically save to model-specific subdirectories
     - Comparison plots save to `comparisons/` directory
     - Directories are created automatically if they don't exist

4. **Created Documentation**:
   - Added README.md explaining the organization
   - Created reorganization script for future use if needed
   - Added test script to verify organization

### Results

- **Total Plots**: 41 (no plots lost during reorganization)
- **Naming Convention**: All plots follow consistent naming patterns
- **No Duplicates**: Each plot exists in exactly one location
- **Clear Organization**: Easy to find plots by model type or comparison type

### Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Plots are now logically grouped by model type
2. **No Duplicates**: Saves disk space and reduces confusion
3. **Easier Navigation**: Clear folder structure makes finding specific plots easier
4. **Future-Proof**: New plots will automatically be saved in the correct location
5. **Consistent Tracking**: The visualization pipeline correctly counts all plots using recursive search

### Scripts Created

1. `/scripts/utilities/reorganize_feature_plots.py` - Reorganizes existing plots
2. `/scripts/utilities/test_feature_plots_organization.py` - Verifies organization

### Code Changes

- Updated `FeatureImportancePlot.plot()` to save to model-specific subdirectories
- Updated `FeatureImportanceComparisonPlot.plot()` to save to comparisons directory
- Updated `_create_heatmap()` to save to comparisons directory
- Updated `create_cross_model_feature_importance()` to save comparison to comparisons directory

All changes ensure backward compatibility while improving organization going forward.
