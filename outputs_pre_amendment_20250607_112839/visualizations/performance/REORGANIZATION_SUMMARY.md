# Performance Plots Reorganization Summary

## Date: 2025-05-31

### What Was Done

1. **Reorganized Performance Plots Structure**:
   - Moved all model-specific optimization plots from root directory to appropriate subdirectories
   - Maintained existing cv_distributions subdirectory structure
   - Kept only metrics_summary_table.png in root directory as intended

2. **Updated Directory Structure**:
   ```
   performance/
   ├── catboost/       (8 plots)  - CatBoost optimization plots
   ├── lightgbm/       (12 plots) - LightGBM optimization plots  
   ├── xgboost/        (8 plots)  - XGBoost optimization plots
   ├── elasticnet/     (15 plots) - ElasticNet optimization plots
   ├── linear/         (0 plots)  - Linear Regression (no optimization)
   ├── cv_distributions/ (4 plots) - Cross-validation distribution plots
   ├── metrics_summary_table.png  - Overall metrics summary
   └── README.md
   ```

3. **Updated Code for Future Consistency**:
   - Modified `src/visualization/comprehensive.py`:
     - Removed hardcoded output_dir for optimization plots
     - Allows optimization.py functions to determine correct subdirectories
   - The `optimization.py` functions already had logic to:
     - Detect model type from model name
     - Create appropriate subdirectories
     - Save plots in the correct location

4. **Created Supporting Tools**:
   - Added reorganization script: `/scripts/utilities/reorganize_performance_plots.py`
   - Added test script: `/scripts/utilities/test_performance_plots_organization.py`
   - Created README.md explaining the organization

### Results

- **Total Plots**: 48 (no plots lost during reorganization)
- **Plot Types**:
  - Optimization history plots: 16
  - Parameter importance plots: 16
  - Contour plots: 8
  - Comparison plots: 3
  - CV distribution plots: 4
  - Summary table: 1
- **Naming Convention**: All plots follow consistent naming patterns
- **Clear Organization**: Plots are grouped by model type and plot purpose

### Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Plots are logically grouped by model type
2. **Easier Navigation**: Clear folder structure makes finding specific plots easier
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new model types or plot types
4. **Future-Proof**: New plots will automatically be saved in the correct location
5. **No Duplicates**: Each plot exists in exactly one location

### Code Changes

- Updated `comprehensive.py` to not override output directories for optimization plots
- The existing `optimization.py` functions already handle subdirectory creation based on model names:
  - `plot_optimization_history()` - Saves to model-specific subdirectory
  - `plot_param_importance()` - Saves to model-specific subdirectory
  - `plot_contour()` / `plot_improved_contour()` - Saves to model-specific subdirectory
- The `cv_distributions.py` already saves to `performance/cv_distributions/`

All changes ensure backward compatibility while improving organization going forward.
