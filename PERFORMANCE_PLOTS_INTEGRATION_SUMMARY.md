# Performance Plots Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated performance optimization visualizations into the main pipeline, ensuring they are automatically generated when running `python main.py --all` or `--visualize`.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Missing CatBoost Performance Plots
- **Issue**: CatBoost performance folder was completely empty
- **Solution**: Generated all missing performance visualizations including:
  - Optuna optimization history plots
  - Parameter importance plots
  - Contour plots for parameter relationships
  - Hyperparameter comparison plots (learning_rate, depth, iterations, l2_leaf_reg)
  - Basic vs Optuna comparison plots
  - Optuna improvement percentage plots

### 2. Incomplete XGBoost Performance Plots
- **Issue**: XGBoost performance folder only contained hyperparameter comparisons
- **Solution**: Added missing Optuna visualizations:
  - Optimization history plots for each Optuna model
  - Parameter importance plots
  - Contour plots
  - Basic vs Optuna comparison
  - Optuna improvement plots

### 3. Integration with Main Pipeline
- **Issue**: Performance plots were not generated when running `main.py --all` or `--visualize`
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified `main.py` to include performance plot generation
  - Added subprocess call to `generate_missing_performance_plots.py`
  - Placed after CV distribution plots in the visualization pipeline

## Technical Details

### Fixed Functions
1. **plot_basic_vs_optuna**: Was receiving dictionary instead of list, fixed to use model_data_list
2. **plot_optuna_improvement**: Same issue, fixed to use model_data_list

### Files Modified
- `/mnt/d/ml_project_refactored/generate_missing_performance_plots.py`
  - Fixed parameter passing to plot_basic_vs_optuna and plot_optuna_improvement
  
- `/mnt/d/ml_project_refactored/main.py`
  - Added performance plot generation in visualization pipeline (lines 662-679)

## Results
- CatBoost performance folder: 18 plots generated
- XGBoost performance folder: 19 plots generated (including previously existing ones)
- All plots now automatically generated via `main.py --all` or `--visualize`

## Key Visualizations Created
1. **Optimization History**: Shows how model performance improved during Optuna optimization
2. **Parameter Importance**: Highlights which hyperparameters had the most impact
3. **Contour Plots**: Shows relationships between parameter pairs
4. **Basic vs Optuna Comparison**: Side-by-side RMSE and RÂ² comparisons
5. **Improvement Plots**: Shows percentage improvement achieved through optimization

## Usage
Performance plots are now automatically generated when running:
```bash
python main.py --all        # Runs full pipeline including performance plots
python main.py --visualize  # Only generates visualizations including performance plots
```

Alternatively, to generate only performance plots:
```bash
python generate_missing_performance_plots.py
```
