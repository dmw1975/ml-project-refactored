# Sector Visualization Fix

This document describes the changes made to fix sector weight visualization issues across different model types.

## Problem

The sector weight visualizations were only working for CatBoost models but were missing for XGBoost, LightGBM, and ElasticNet models. This was because only CatBoost models were saving the X_test data needed for sector distribution analysis.

## Solution

The following changes were implemented to fix this issue:

1. **Enhanced Model Training Code**:
   - Modified `xgboost_model.py`, `lightgbm_model.py`, and `elastic_net.py` to save X_test data alongside other model information.
   - This ensures that new models trained will include the necessary sector information.

2. **Created Migration Script**:
   - Developed `scripts/migrate_model_files.py` to add X_test data to existing model files.
   - The script loads the raw data and reconstructs X_test for each model based on y_test indices.
   - Uses gics_sector_* columns instead of Sector_* columns for sector information.

3. **Deprecated Stratification Module**:
   - The `visualization_new/plots/stratification.py` module is now marked as deprecated.
   - Added `_DEPRECATED_MODULE = True` flag to prevent file generation from this module.

4. **Focused Sector Weight Visualization**:
   - The `visualization_new/plots/sector_weights.py` module now provides focused visualizations directly in the sectors/ directory.
   - It filters out models with names starting with "Sector_" if requested.

## Files Modified

1. **Training Code**:
   - `/models/xgboost_model.py`: Added X_test to saved model data
   - `/models/lightgbm_model.py`: Added X_test to saved model data
   - `/models/elastic_net.py`: Added X_test to saved model data

2. **Migration Script**:
   - `/scripts/migrate_model_files.py`: New script to add X_test data to existing model files
   - `/scripts/check_sector_columns.py`: Script to check for sector columns in raw data

3. **Testing**:
   - `/test_sector_visualization.py`: Test script to verify sector visualization functionality

## Results

- All models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, ElasticNet) now have sector weight visualizations.
- Files are generated directly in the sectors/ directory, not in sectors/stratification/.
- No files with names starting with "Sector_*.png" are generated.

## Future Work

For new models, the updated training code will automatically save the X_test data needed for sector visualizations, ensuring this feature works for all model types going forward.
