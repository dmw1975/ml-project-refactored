# Fix Summary: Adding Optuna Optimization to Categorical Models

## Problem Identified
You correctly identified that `lightgbm_categorical.py` and `xgboost_categorical.py` were missing Optuna optimization, which is why:
- They only saved raw Booster objects instead of full dictionary format
- They didn't have y_test/y_pred data needed for evaluation
- LightGBM and XGBoost visualizations were missing from the pipeline

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Enhanced Implementations
- `enhanced_lightgbm_categorical.py` - Combines categorical support with Optuna optimization
- `enhanced_xgboost_categorical.py` - Combines categorical support with Optuna optimization

### 2. Key Features Added
- **Optuna Optimization**: Both now perform hyperparameter tuning like their non-categorical counterparts
- **Dual Model Training**: Each dataset now produces both basic and Optuna-optimized models
- **Proper Data Format**: Models are saved in dictionary format with all required metadata
- **NaN Handling**: Robust handling of missing values in both features and target
- **Feature Name Cleaning**: LightGBM-specific JSON-compatible feature names

### 3. Integration with Pipeline
- Updated `models/lightgbm_categorical.py` to redirect to enhanced version
- Updated `models/xgboost_categorical.py` to redirect to enhanced version
- Added `train_*_categorical_models()` wrapper functions for compatibility

## What This Fixes

1. **Complete Model Training**: Both basic and Optuna-optimized models are now trained
2. **Proper Model Format**: Models saved with full metadata (y_test, y_pred, metrics, etc.)
3. **Visualization Support**: Models now compatible with the visualization pipeline
4. **Feature Importance**: Proper feature importance calculation and storage

## How to Use

The pipeline will now work correctly with:
```bash
python main.py --all
```

Or individually:
```bash
python main.py --train-lightgbm
python main.py --train-xgboost
```

## Expected Outputs

For each model type (LightGBM/XGBoost) and dataset (Base/Yeo/Base_Random/Yeo_Random):
- Basic model (e.g., `lightgbm_base_categorical_basic.pkl`)
- Optuna model (e.g., `lightgbm_base_categorical_optuna.pkl`)
- Feature importance CSV files
- Full visualization suite including:
  - Feature importance plots
  - Optimization history plots
  - Hyperparameter comparison plots
  - Model performance metrics

## Note
The first run will take longer as Optuna performs hyperparameter optimization (50 trials by default). 
Subsequent runs will use cached models unless forced to retrain.
