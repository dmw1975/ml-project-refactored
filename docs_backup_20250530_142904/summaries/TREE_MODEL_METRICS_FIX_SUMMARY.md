# Tree Model Metrics Fix Summary

## Problem
Tree models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) were missing standard metrics (RMSE, MAE, MSE, R2) at the top level of their result dictionaries, causing visualization errors.

## Solution Applied
Updated all three enhanced model implementations to include standard metrics:

1. **enhanced_xgboost_categorical.py**
2. **enhanced_lightgbm_categorical.py** 
3. **enhanced_catboost_categorical.py**

### Changes Made
Added the following keys to each model's result dictionary:
```python
'RMSE': metrics['test_rmse'],
'MAE': metrics['test_mae'], 
'MSE': metrics['test_rmse'] ** 2,
'R2': metrics['test_r2'],
```

These are in addition to the existing 'metrics' dictionary that contains detailed train/test metrics.

## Next Steps
To apply these fixes, you need to retrain the tree models:

```bash
python main.py --train-xgboost --train-lightgbm --train-catboost
```

Or to retrain all models at once:
```bash
python main.py --all
```

## Verification
After retraining, the models will have the correct metric structure compatible with the visualization system. The metrics will be available both:
- At the top level (RMSE, MAE, MSE, R2) for compatibility
- In the 'metrics' dict with train/test prefixes for detailed analysis

This ensures compatibility with both the existing visualization system and any code that expects the detailed metrics format.
