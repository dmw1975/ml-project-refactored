# Visualization Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the visualization system cleanup performed to standardize the directory structure and consolidate the codebase.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Directory Structure Standardization

- Fixed the directory structure in `visualization_new` to use a consistent type-based organization
- Modified `get_visualization_dir()` function to extract model types correctly
- Updated file naming to maintain unique names while preserving key model information
- Removed unwanted CatBoost_* directories while preserving their contents

### 2. Code Reorganization

- Ensured all visualization modules have proper deprecation warnings
- Created proper documentation of the directory structure
- Updated README files to point to the new documentation
- Created a clear timeline for phasing out legacy code

### 3. Documentation

- Created `visualization_new/DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md` to document the standardized directory structure
- Updated `README_NEW_VIZ.md` to include information about the output directory structure
- Created `VISUALIZATION_LEGACY_PHASEOUT.md` with a timeline and steps for phasing out legacy code
- Enhanced the main README with information about the visualization system

### 4. Tools and Scripts

- Created `cleanup_catboost_directories.py` script to remove unwanted directories
- Simplified the directory structure by consolidating model-specific directories
- Ensured backwards compatibility for existing code

## Current State

The visualization system now:

1. Uses a consistent type-based directory structure:
   - `/outputs/visualizations/features/catboost/`
   - `/outputs/visualizations/residuals/catboost/`
   - `/outputs/visualizations/performance/catboost/`

2. Generates all visualization outputs with standardized naming:
   - `features/catboost/top_features_base_basic.png`
   - `residuals/catboost/residuals_yeo_optuna.png`

3. Has eliminated unwanted CatBoost_* directories from the root visualization folder

4. Provides clear documentation of the directory structure and phase-out plan

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All visualizations now follow the same organization pattern
2. **Reduced Clutter**: No more proliferation of model-specific directories
3. **Clear Organization**: Visualizations are grouped by type first, then model
4. **Future-proof**: The structure works for all model types and will support future enhancements
5. **Improved Navigation**: Users can easily find visualizations by type

## Next Steps

1. Complete the phase-out plan for legacy visualization code
2. Add tests for visualization directory structure
3. Update any remaining scripts or notebooks to use the new architecture

The cleanup has successfully standardized the visualization directory structure and provided a clear path for phasing out legacy code, ensuring that future enhancements will only need to be implemented once in the new architecture.
