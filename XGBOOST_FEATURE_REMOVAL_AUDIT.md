# XGBoost Feature Removal Audit Summary

## Date: 2025-06-20

### Issues Found:

1. **Wrong Script Being Used**
   - The iterative script (`xgboost_feature_removal_iterative.py`) was being run instead of the proper script
   - This created multiple iterations instead of a simple before/after comparison

2. **Path Issue**
   - Fixed: Path was hardcoded to `D:/ml_project_refactored/outputs_pre_amendment_20250619_210459/`
   - Changed to: `self.base_output_dir / "visualization" / "xgboost_feature_removal_metrics_analysis.csv"`

3. **Feature Names Clarification**
   - The code correctly uses: `top_1_shareholder_percentage`, `top_2_shareholder_percentage`, `top_3_shareholder_percentage`
   - Not: `shareholder_percentage_1`, `shareholder_percentage_2`, `shareholder_percentage_3`
   - These are the actual column names in the dataset

### Correct Implementation Details:

The `xgboost_feature_removal_proper.py` script correctly:
1. Removes exactly 4 features:
   - `top_1_shareholder_percentage`
   - `top_2_shareholder_percentage`
   - `top_3_shareholder_percentage`
   - `random_feature`

2. Performs simple before/after comparison:
   - Loads existing optimized model WITH all features
   - Trains new optimized model WITHOUT the 4 features
   - Compares performance metrics

3. Processes both datasets:
   - Base_Random (with 34 features initially, 30 after removal)
   - Yeo_Random (with 34 features initially, 30 after removal)

### Expected CSV Output:

The CSV should contain exactly 4 rows:
```
Row 1: Base_Random with all features
Row 2: Base_Random without 4 features
Row 3: Yeo_Random with all features
Row 4: Yeo_Random without 4 features
```

### Actions Taken:

1. Fixed the path issue in `xgboost_feature_removal_proper.py`
2. Confirmed the correct features are being removed
3. Verified the script implements simple before/after comparison (not iterative)
4. The proper script is now running with Optuna optimization (100 trials)

### Next Steps:

Once the script completes, verify that:
1. The CSV contains exactly 4 rows as expected
2. The metrics show the impact of removing the 4 features
3. The results are saved to the correct location: `/outputs/feature_removal/visualization/`
