# Adapter Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Linear Regression Adapter
**Issue**: Missing return statement in `get_metadata()` method causing "NoneType has no attribute 'get'" errors.

**Fix**: Added `return metadata` statement at line 145 of `/mnt/d/ml_project_refactored/visualization_new/adapters/linear_regression_adapter.py`

### 2. CatBoost Adapter
**Issue**: Feature importance DataFrame had columns ['feature', 'importance'] but adapter expected ['Feature', 'Importance'] (capitalized).

**Fix**: Added column renaming logic in `get_feature_importance()` method to handle both naming conventions:
```python
# Handle different column naming conventions
if 'feature' in importance_df.columns and 'Feature' not in importance_df.columns:
    importance_df = importance_df.rename(columns={'feature': 'Feature'})
if 'importance' in importance_df.columns and 'Importance' not in importance_df.columns:
    importance_df = importance_df.rename(columns={'importance': 'Importance'})
```

## Verification

After fixes, the visualization pipeline successfully generated:
- 36 residual plots
- Baseline comparison plots
- Feature importance plots
- Performance comparison plots
- Statistical test plots
- And more...

Total: 113+ visualizations created successfully.

## Status
✅ All adapter issues resolved
✅ Visualization pipeline working correctly
✅ All model types properly integrated
