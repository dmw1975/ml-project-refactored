# Consolidated Baseline Visualization Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a new consolidated baseline comparison visualization that combines all three baseline types (mean, median, random) into a single plot per metric, reducing redundancy and improving visual comparison.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Visualization Module
Created `/visualization_new/plots/consolidated_baselines.py` with:
- `create_consolidated_baseline_comparison()` - Creates a single plot showing all baselines
- `create_consolidated_baseline_visualizations()` - Generates plots for all metrics

### 2. Key Features
- **Single plot per metric** instead of 3 separate plots (9 plots → 3 plots)
- **All baselines shown as lines** with different styles:
  - Mean baseline: Solid red line
  - Median baseline: Dashed cyan line  
  - Random baseline: Dotted gray line
- **Improvement calculated relative to best baseline** (hardest to beat)
- **Clear labeling** shows which baseline was used for improvement calculation

### 3. Visual Enhancements
- Model performance shown as horizontal bars (colored by model type)
- Baseline lines overlaid on each model's bar
- Improvement percentage shown with baseline type (e.g., "14.3% vs Mean")
- Dual legend system: one for model types, one for baseline types

### 4. Generated Files
New consolidated plots created:
- `RMSE_consolidated_baseline_comparison.png`
- `MAE_consolidated_baseline_comparison.png`
- `R²_consolidated_baseline_comparison.png`

## Benefits
1. **Reduced redundancy** - 66% fewer plots while preserving all information
2. **Better comparison** - All baselines visible simultaneously
3. **More meaningful improvements** - Calculated against the toughest baseline
4. **Space efficient** - Easier to include in reports/presentations

## Usage
```python
from visualization_new.plots.consolidated_baselines import create_consolidated_baseline_visualizations

# Create consolidated baseline visualizations
paths = create_consolidated_baseline_visualizations(
    baseline_data_path='path/to/baseline_comparison.csv',
    output_dir='path/to/output',
    metrics=['RMSE', 'MAE', 'R²']
)
```

## Results
The visualization clearly shows that:
- Mean baseline is consistently the hardest to beat across all models
- All models show significant improvement over baselines
- Tree-based models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) perform best
- Improvements range from ~10-14% over the mean baseline for RMSE
