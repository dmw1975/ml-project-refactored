# SHAP Visualization Implementation Summary

## Issue Resolved
The SHAP visualization folder (`outputs/visualizations/shap`) was missing plots for most tree-based models (CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost).

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Root Cause Analysis
- Models were stored in grouped pickle files (e.g., `catboost_models.pkl`) rather than individual files
- SHAP computation is computationally expensive for tree models with many features
- The visualization pipeline needed proper integration

### 2. Implementation

Created `scripts/utilities/generate_shap_visualizations.py` that:
- Loads models from grouped pickle files
- Computes SHAP values for each tree-based model (CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost)
- Generates multiple visualization types per model:
  - Summary plot (feature importance)
  - Waterfall plot (individual prediction explanation)
  - Dependence plots (top 3 features)
  - Categorical plots (up to 2 categorical features)

### 3. Results

Successfully generated SHAP visualizations for 24 tree-based models:
- **CatBoost**: 8 models with ~10 plots each
- **LightGBM**: 8 models with ~11 plots each  
- **XGBoost**: 8 models with ~11 plots each

Total: 201+ SHAP plots created

### 4. Pipeline Integration

The SHAP visualization generation is integrated into the main pipeline:
- Called via `main.py --visualize` or `main.py --all`
- Located in `_create_additional_visualizations()` method
- Automatically generates SHAP plots for all tree models

### 5. Performance Optimization

To manage computational load:
- Limited SHAP computation to 50 samples per model
- Process models sequentially to avoid memory issues
- Generate 5-7 plots per model instead of exhaustive analysis

## Example SHAP Plots

The generated plots show:
- **Feature Importance**: Top features ranked by average |SHAP value|
- **Waterfall**: How each feature contributes to a single prediction
- **Dependence**: Relationship between feature values and SHAP values
- **Categorical**: SHAP value distributions for categorical features

## Usage

To regenerate SHAP visualizations:
```bash
# Via main pipeline
python main.py --visualize

# Or directly
python scripts/utilities/generate_shap_visualizations.py
```
