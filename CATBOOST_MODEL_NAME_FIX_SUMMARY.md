# CatBoost (and XGBoost) Model Name Fix Summary

## Issue Found
CatBoost models were being loaded with "Unknown" as the model_type, causing visualization files to be named "Unknown_residuals.png" instead of the proper model names.

## Root Cause
The issue was that CatBoost (and XGBoost) models were being saved without a `model_name` field in their model data dictionaries. When the visualization adapters tried to get the model name, they would default to "Unknown".

## Files Fixed

### 1. Enhanced Model Training Scripts
- `/scripts/archive/enhanced_catboost_categorical.py`
  - Added `'model_name': model_key` to both basic and optuna model results
  
- `/scripts/archive/enhanced_xgboost_categorical.py`
  - Added `'model_name': model_key` to both basic and optuna model results

### 2. Existing Model Data
- Fixed existing saved models by adding the missing `model_name` field:
  - 8 CatBoost models updated
  - 8 XGBoost models updated
  - Linear Regression, ElasticNet, and LightGBM models already had the field

## Impact
After this fix:
- All new CatBoost and XGBoost models will be saved with the correct `model_name` field
- Existing models have been updated to include this field
- Visualization outputs will now use proper model names instead of "Unknown"
  - e.g., `CatBoost_Base_categorical_basic_residuals.png` instead of `Unknown_residuals.png`

## Verification
All 32 models in the project now have the `model_name` field properly set, ensuring consistent naming across all visualizations and outputs.
